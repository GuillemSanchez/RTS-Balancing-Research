# RTS Balancing
I am Guillem Sánchez, student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).
In this Website I'm gonna explain how works the balance of units and some other stuff in RTS video games like Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Ensemble Studios or Praetorians, Pyro Studios.

But, What is balancing in a game?

For me, balancing a game means that any of the game elements are ineffective or undesirable to play with or against.

"An important trait of any game is the illusion of winnability. If a game is to provide a continuing challenge to players, it must also provide a continuing motivation to play. The game must appear to be winnable to all players, beginners and experts, but it must never truly be winnable or it will lose its appeal."

### — Chris Crawford


## What gamers expect of RTS?

The easy way to answer this question is saying that it depends on of the type of strategic gamer that we are asking. RTS fans have largely split off and gravitated towards games that tickled their particular itches more. For real-time battles, you've got Total War. For supply chain management, you've got Factorio. For base-building, you've got Rimworld. For bigger-picture campaigns you've got Paradox's offerings; just as examples.

Gamers will expect of sure that you can craft, refine and execute a strategy, they want to be creative and piece the tools that we give to them together to make powerful strategies, like unit compositions, timing attacks or build orders.It'ss not the amount of tools that we give to them is the amount of possibles combinations that can be done.

### Asymmetric Desing

This is an important point that most of the gamers will search nowadays in RTS games, this "fun generator" affects a lot of areas of the game, for example this will make factions more unique, so players could choose according to their preferences about their play style or the aesthetics. Maps can have asymmetric design to, that will make the 1 player campaign more fun and diverse.

### RNG

RNG stands for random number generation, some people think that RNG shouldn't be present in RTS games, because they don't want any type of luck in the game, but most of the player basis thinks that RNG can be implemented in that type of games IF the player can influence with some type of strategy or skill to increment the "luck" of some actions, for example, covering some soldiers behind a rock to get a better change of wining a skirmish. RNG makes the game less predictable and adds tension to the game play.

### Unit diferentation

Unit differentiation is really important to an RTS and is something that you should look at any moment to make your game fun to play, units need to feel different to the player, it's not the same have an army of motorcycles, fast and with great mobility, or have an army of tanks, slow but powerful. There's is nothing satisfying about just attack/moving your units, units should be designed in a way that rewards players for being creative.

## What gamers expect of RTS Balance?

There's at misconception that balances only matters to high-level players, but that is not true, balance is crucial in making an RTS fun.

What we would be the point of having 30 units if only 10 of then are useful?

Let's say a player strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with some type of bombers (air-ships), they must overcome the fact that bombers are vulnerable to other air units, to complement the bombers the player relies on an antiair infantry. If the antiair infantry is under powered the strategy will fail, that will cause frustration to the player because the strategy failed for reasons which are not faults of their own, the problem was poor balance.

Gamers don't want to have units that doesn't perform its intended role, or a overpower unit that prevents another from doing so. Imbalance is bad and things that are underperfoming or overpowered should be fixed, but good "balance" doesn't make and RTS game more balanced, it emphasizes the unique qualities of each unit, creating more decisions about which tools are used and how they are used.

Gamers like the "meta" but we need to have a flexible and varied meta, given the opportunity to break the current meta with some strategies, to archive that we need to do a good balance of the game, if not players will start to massing the same unit all the time and that is NOT funny.


## Tactics vs Strategy

First we need to know the difference between Strategy and Tactics/skill.

Strategy is a complete algorithm for playing the game, telling a player what to do for every possible situation throughout the game. Its more about resource management and global vision. We will call it Macromanagement (or macro)

Tactics/skills are short-term actions to attain specific goals. More about units management. We will call it Micromanagement (Micro)

Which is better for our game? It depends, games like starcraft are more focused in the micro, and are good, but game like Civ are more about macro, and also are good. Nowadays, every RTS (excepting some 4X games) have micro in their game play, because is really difficult to avoid it.

[Usefull](https://www.spacesector.com/blog/2011/12/strategy-vs-tactics-in-video-games-a-small-essay/) information

### 4X games
4x or (grand strategy games)are by definition board games in which players control an empire and "explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate". That type of games are more based in macrogestion that any other. In grand strategy and 4X games you typically don't have much to do with tactics. You decide the target and the resources you wish to use on that target. Everything that comes after that, namely the tactics, depends on the people who are so tiny that you can't even see them on your interface. Examples of this are Freeciv, Civilization series, or Supremacy 1914.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillemSanchez/RTS_balancing_Research/master/Docs/Images/4X.jpg)

In theory, strategy/macromanagement is by default more important. The player who comes victorious out of a session is usually the one that could read the game more accurately. In a scenario of two players equally capable in micromanagement, the one who would apply the better macromanagementwould win most of the times.


On the other hand, intensive micromanagement can distract players from macromanagement. The players should make long term decisions, but if they do not have the required speed to execute their moves faster than their opponents, then the strategic part becomes insignificant.


In conclusion, a rough outline of what are the defining characteristics of RTS are can be found in what the senior producer of Command & Conquer: Generals, has said. 


“The fundamentals of these games are pretty similar: they generally have maps or levels to explore and fight over, resources that can be harvested to build structures and units, armies that move and fight, and a technology or “research” tree that unlocks more powerful units and capabilities over time” (Bates 2004)

## Visible vs Hidden Balancing

There are 2 main kinds of unit balancing, the first one is the visible, this kind is balances that can be directly seen by the player, range of a shot, speed of a unit or type of movement (ground unit, sea unit, flying unit).

The second type of unit balancing is hidden balancing, This kind of balancing is used in the games rules, changing probabilities for events or efficiencies of abilities. Examples of abstract balancing are stats like health, damages, crit. Hidden balancing is usually presented to the player through text labels in the UI (user interface).

## Unit Balancing basics

Now we barely know what is balancing a game, but was is the meaning of this?
Would you rather play a game that allows this?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillemSanchez/RTS_balancing_Research/master/Docs/Images/Age_empires_cheats.gif)

It's a bit extremely, but this is NOT fun, we want to avoid this in our games, that is why Units are one of the core components of any RTS video game. It is important to have a balanced roster of units. Without a good unit balance, the game would be like a farming simulation with some types of units that can destroy the rival farm.


## Rock/Paper/Scisors

One way of unit balancing is using the "Ol' reliable" Rock/Paper/Scissors, we have three types of entities, consisting of rock, paper and scissors; and these entities counteract each other: rock wins scissors, scissors wins paper and paper wins rock. Then we only need to change the names of the entities, and PUFFF we have a good balanced game...

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillemSanchez/RTS_balancing_Research/master/Docs/Images/Rock_Paper_Scisors.png)

#### NOOOOO! Our game doesnt work WHYYYYYYY?????

Our little problem here is that our game is more complicated that the ancient game of Rock/Paper/Scissors, our game have a lot of variables like resources and stats, but we will use the same strategy of R/P/S to solve this problem.


But first lets settle the bases and some math about why is a fair and balanced game the Rock/Paper/Scissors. Let's make a table with the possible results of a game of R/P/S, the R will mean rock, the P will main paper and the S will mean scissors. If we interpret the results of this table as points, for winning a game, we would obtain + 1 point, for losing -1 points, and for a tie we would obtain 0 points. The first column will be our hand (RM/PM/SM) and the first row will be the opponents hand.

| |R|P|S|
|----|-----|-----|-----|
|RM|0|-1|1|
|PM|1|0|-1|
|SM|-1|1|0|

With this table we can extract the next equations:

#### RM = 0 * R + (- 1) * P + (+ 1) * S

#### PM = (+ 1) * R + 0 * P + (- 1) * S

#### SM = (- 1) * R + (+ 1) * P + 0 * S

simplifying,

#### RM = S - P
#### PM = R - S
#### SM = P - R

R/P/S is a special type of game known as zero-sum games, that means that we gain and lose the same amount of utility, for example, in the first equation RM = 0 * R + (- 1) * P + (+ 1) * S the taking the variables of the right side of the equation goes like this RM = 0 - 1 + 1, the same as RM = 0, that situation means that we don't gain, but we don't lose anything. With that we can take that:

#### RM = SM = PM = 0 
(only on the left side of the equation)

If we suppose that we will take the same amount of times all the possibilities we can get this equation:

#### R + S + P = 1 
(only on the right side of the equation)


With this two equations we can get this:

#### RM = S - P
#### PM = R - S
#### SM = P - R

#### RM = SM = PM = 0 


#### 0 = S - P
#### 0 = R - S
#### 0 = P - R

S = P

R = S

P = R

We can subsitute this in the next equation:

#### R + S + P = 1 

#### R + R + R = 1
#### R = 1/3

And we get the same if we use the other variables.

#### R = 1/3
#### P = 1/3
#### S = 1/3

## Weakness Support

The method that we were exploring is when you design your units to be strong against a specific type of enemy unit (or type of units), and weak against another. Weakness Support, is when you make sure that all units have a certain weakness. The difference to rock-paper-scissors is that the weakness is based on a stat of the unit, and not on the stat of an enemy unit. For example, the weakness with infantry in the R/P/S is that it's vulnerable to archers. In Weakness support scenario the infantry's weakness would be slow movement.

The “support” in weakness support refers to how the players should reinforce the unit's weakness. For example, if the infantry is slow-moving, then maybe its “weakness support” is wagons which can transport infantry quickly into battle.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillemSanchez/RTS_balancing_Research/master/Docs/Images/Weakness_support.png)

## Numbers and more Numbers

Let's take again the R/P/S equations and lets apply it to our games. First we need to define our three types of units that we wanna apply the R/P/S system. Let's say that we have a spear men, a knight (in a horse) and an archer. Now we need to define each roll, archers have long-range attacks that will be lethal to our spear men, but the spear men with their spears can kill the knights easy, and our knights are too fast to get killed before they charge to our archers, so spear men win against knights, knights win against archers and archers win against the spear men.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillemSanchez/RTS_balancing_Research/master/Docs/Images/Charge.gif)

As R/P/S we need some type of measure to track our balances. Every unit will have a cost, hp, and attack, the attack will the damage ratio that the unit does to the other type's of unit, so we will have three type of damage:

ID: bonus or damage against infantry units (spear men)
RD: bonus or damage against ranged units (archers)
CD: bonus or damage against cavalry units (knights)

here is the table of stats:

|Type|Cost|HP|ID|CD|RD|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Spear men|120|90|8|16|0|
|Archer|60|80|10|4|6|
|Knight|220|200|16|16|10|

You can see that the knight is overpowered, but is that really true? Let's see

First lets make a table like we did it in R/P/S. Let's call "A" our unit and "B" rival's unit, we will use the next formula to calculate the result, the formula is difficult, I will link a table to an excel that it will do it automatically. This formula is taken out of this [link](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/685693-rts-unit-balance/?tab=comments#comment-5329035).

Formula:

Min((A cost/ B dmg (against A)), ((B Hp/ A dmg (against B)) * (A dmg (Against B) * (B cost/ B hp) - (B dmg (against A) * (A cost/A hp)))

That formula will give us the result of a 1 vs 1 unit combat efficiency, if the result is positive means that our unit would be more efficient (less resource wasting) than the enemy unit. 

Let's make our table: (S means spear men, A means archer and K means Knight, if the acronym have an M means that is our unit)


| |S|A|K|
|----|-----|-----|-----|
|SM|0|-20|38|
|AM|20|0|-38|
|KM|-38|38|0|

Every one of the sections are calculated with the formula from before.

Now lets use the formulas from R/P/S to take the percents and see if our game is balanced or not.

(Zero-sum)
#### SM = AM = KM = 0 

(all posibilities)
#### S + A + K = 1 

(Table resuls)

#### SM = 0 * S + (- 20) * A + (+ 38) * K

#### AM = (+ 20) * S + 0 * A + (- 38) * K

#### KM = (- 38) * S + (+ 38) * A + 0 * K

simplified,

#### SM = - 20A + 38K

#### AM = 20S - 38K

#### KM = - 38S + 38A

With the 2 equations (zero-sum, all posibilities)

#### 20A = 38K

#### 20S = 38K

#### 38S = 38A


#### S + A + K = 1 

let's calculate the results:

#### A = 38/96 = 0,39

#### K = 760/2604 = 0,29

#### S = ... = 0,32

From the results of the probability calculation, it can be taken that our theoretical RTS video game would actually be fairly balanced, being the three probabilities of the opponent utilizing the units rounding the 0,33. The unit or unit type that would be most underutilized in this hypothetical RTS game would be the knight. If the designer of this game preferred to make gunmen a more relevant unit, they would likely have to decrease the unit’s cost or change some of the stats.

If you download the excel you can make the same with your units, if you wanna add more units apart from the three i recommend to go to this [link](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/685693-rts-unit-balance/?tab=comments#comment-5329035), I based all this section in how this works, the only problem is that the spreadsheet doesn't give the percents at the end.

## Maths in game economy

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillemSanchez/RTS_balancing_Research/master/Docs/Images/Resources.jpg)

RTS always have an internal economy in some type of form, usually you need to gather resources and manage them. Without and economy the game will be more like an RTT, with only troop control.


The first step for creating a game economy system is to determine every resource type that the player will be able to gather in the game. There’s no set number on how many resources the game should have, but the game balancing is way more controllable when the game has a low number of resource types.


Every resource type needs to have a certain rarity regarding the others. This is represented mathematically with a rarity index; If the resource is common the rarity index will be near 1, but if the resources is more exotic the index will increment.


If we wanna calculate the index of the resources, first we need to determine how many resources will be in the most basic scenario and how many resources every resource type will have.


For example, our scenario will have in total 3000 resources.


1.231 of these resources will be rock
1.769 will be wood


We have more wood than rock, so wood as being more common than rock will have a rarity index of 1. To calculate the rarity index, we’ll need to divide the two resources by the total quantity of resources.


Wood/resources = 0,59 rock/resources = 0,41


To obtain the rarity index we will just subtract the result of the most common resource with the one that we want to obtain the index from, and then add 1 to the result.

#### index = 1 + 0,59 - 0,41 = 1,18

With this rarity index we will be able to calculate the total cost of anything we want to calculate the cost from, being buildings, units...; Using this formula:

#### cost(n) = a * aRI + b * bRI + … + (n-1) * (n-1)RI + n * nRI

n = quantity of resources

I = rarity index

a, b... = resources type


## Final thoughts

First of all I hope that you found useful this document and that you have learned something. Some last tips that I can give are that none of the methods explained in the document will be 100% effective on balancing an RTS game, but they will serve as a guide to balance your games and can be adapted to whatever you are making.


The process is slow and it's really important to play test your game constantly to see how the balance is going and solve any overpowered unit. No methodology in game design is completely accurate and will not determine how fun a game is for the most part, but if you follow this guides I'm sure that will be more easy and fun to play.
